# shell-scripts
Some shell scripts we use at SURFsara.

## dell

### dell-tsr
A script that uses racadm to create a Dell Technical Support Report. This can also be done through the iDrac interface, but this script does it on the command line. If an email address is provided on the command line, the report is sent when it is complete.

## watch-diff
Runs the given command repeatedly and reports any changes in its output.
